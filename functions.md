a named function is a reusable block of code written to perform a task.
A function can have any number of parameters
```javascript
function name ( paramater1, parameter2 ) {
    console.log( parameter1 - parameter2 )
}
```
This function will print to the console the difference between parameter1 and parameter2

anonymous functions can't be called and will fire once

```javascript
function ( p1, p2 ) {
    do the thing
}
```
this function will do the thing
