# html markup
Below is the basic markup of an html file
The first line declares the html document and then it is split up into a head with meta data
about the document and a body with the data that will be seen in a browser
```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

#pug
pug has a similar markup except without <> and indentation is no longer optional
Pug is rendered as html in the browser
