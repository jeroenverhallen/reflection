for and why loops are functions that can loop through a block of code, for example an array.
If you know the number of iterations, use a for loop.
If you need a loop to continue as long as a certain condition is valid, use a while loop
```javascript
for ( i = 0; i < imax; i++ ) {
    do a thing with i
}
while ( condition ) {
    do something with a variable stated in the condition, then repeat if condition not yet met
}
```
