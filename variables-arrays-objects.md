variables are containers for storing data.
An array is a bunch of variables written between [] and separated by comma's.
An object is a bunch of keys with their value written between {}
you can get the n'th value of array named array by writing array[n-1]
you can get the value of keyn from an object named object by writing object.keyn
```javascript
var array = [ 'value1', 'value2', 3 ]
array[1] //this wil give the value 'value2'
var object = { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2', key3: 3 }
object.key3 // this wil give the value 3
```
